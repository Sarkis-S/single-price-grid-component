## My process
- Figure out the structure of the component (thinking in boxes)
  * I decided to use CSS Grid this time just to try and learn something new
- Given a style guide determine how I can make best use of them
  * I decided to use SCSS/SASS so that I can take advante of reusable varable styles
- Center main element to the middle of the desktop
- Apply the styling for mobile view
- Apply the styling for desktop view
- Apply the hover effect
- Apply font from Google fonts
- Editing and many more touch ups
- Complete README
- Host component live

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow


### What I learned

Although this was a simple component I was pleasantly surprised how much work I had put into it. It's a super fun project as I spent much time being extremely meticulous about the fine details, which required plenty of CSS work. If I learned anything in this challenge it would definitely be the understanding of how CSS puts everything together. I've also learned how CSS Grid can be a powerful tool in controlling the layout of the page. I may just use it more often in the future.
